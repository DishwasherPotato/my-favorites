        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite manga: Tokyo Ghoul (and Re)</p>

        <p>Tokyo Ghoul is a manga created by Sui Ishida and is about the conflict between ghouls and humans</p>
        <p>I like Tokyo Ghoul because it has a really beautiful and well thought out story that I dont think many people notice.</p>
        <p>I heavily suggest reading Tokyo Ghoul if your into both tragedy, psychological thriller, and fantasy.</p>
        <p>This is a GOATED manga and is my TOP 1 above One Piece, Baki, JJK, and Dr Stone</p>
        <p>watch this review video. Its good. also DONT watch the anime of tokyo ghoul. its buns.</p>
