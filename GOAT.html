        <h3>Arima Kishou</h3>
        <p><em>The White Reaper</em></p>
        the WHITE REAPER, oh my god where do I begin. This man quite litterally is HIM he is HIM. Arima is part of the CCG, organization made to combat the ghouls. Technically on the bad guys side but lets actually talk about this. Arima NEVER LOST A FADE Kishou. Arima is THE STRONGEST in the whole verse. It's no competition. In every fight Arima dog walks every single person. ghoul, ccg, quinx, it doesnt matter he COOKS! Without saying too much Arima put the MC Ken Kaneki in his place not once but twice, did not try either time! Arima didnt even go down by anyone. Arima went down to HIMSELF!! YES HE HAD TO TAKE HIMSELF OUT THE SERIES!!!! And dont get it twisted, ARIMA IS NOT BAD, I can not say too much since spoilers, but Arima was not actually an opp even though it looked like he was. Arima is so goated arguably the most respected man in the verse second only to ghoul jesus ken kaneki.

        <h3>Ken Kaneki</h3>
        <p><em>The One-Eyed King</em></p>
        Ghoul Jesus himself, The One Eyed King OH MY GOD THAT NAME IS SO TOUGH! Kaneki had so much character development throughout the story. The phases he went through his character arcs were UNMATCHED! you really felt for the man, you FELT his anger, you FELT his sadness, you FELT his uncertinty, YOU FELT HIS CHARACTER! Kaneki hit me harder than ANY MC ever, He arguably one of the most real MCs ever too! like he actually went through it, had reasonable crashouts had times where he didnt know what to do he made the hard decision and he walked forward. sure he sometimes went in circles, sometimes he took the wrong path but thats what makes him GREAT!. Kaneki aint perfect, and from start to finish it remains that way, after the journey was over none of those moments left our hearts. Kaneki change THE WORLD! and as you read it you'll understand how and why. He hated what he, he hated the life forced upon him yet he lived on! sure every hurdle he had a different reason, whether it be for friends, for revenge, for no reason but for motion, he did. and it may have took nearly the whole manga to find who he was, but when he did he knew, he knew he was the only one that could fix everything! and every one of himself that made him who he was that day stood to watch him mend the cracks that ran deep through that world. and thats whats beautiful. thats what makes him amazing. thats what makes him, the GOAT.
